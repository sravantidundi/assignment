4. Discuss:  If you could solve this problem with a unique config file for every host instead of a template, would you do that? Why or why not?


For this I can bake this configuration file as part of the VM image so that it takes away the config time 
dependency to the provision time
or we can also use push based tool like ansible to deploy a specific file to a single host.
